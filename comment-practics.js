I preordered the book "Marhaba, Javascript e Maro Thaba" from Rokomari.com. 
Initially, the book's price was 780tk, but after the preorder discount, the price decreased to 585tk. 
I had to pay an extra 48tk as Online Platform Charges. 
However, when I received the book, the total cost was 645tk as I chose Cash on Delivery. 
Since I didn't have that amount of cash in hand, I sent the money along with the Bkash cashout charge to the Courier Brother.
